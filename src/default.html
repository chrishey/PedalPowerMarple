					<p>I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Alright, punk, now- He's a very strange young man. Well, this is a radiation suit.</p>

					<p>See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. No, bastards. I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying.</p>

					<p>It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Doc. In that case, I'll tell you strait out. That's right. You're George McFly.</p>
